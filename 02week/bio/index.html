  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p1>
    I will go ahead and cut to the chase - I'm currently looking to become a Software Developer. Only if I would have known this -- let's say 10 years ago! I dabbed around with HTML and CSS during the Myspace era. Unfortunately,
    I became side tracked playing sports at the highschool and collegiate level.
  </p1>
  <p2> Austin Coding Academy is where I'm developing my skills <(no pun intended) to further my career. When I'm not doing personal projects or in class with my amazing instructor Dinh - you can find me trying out new restaraunts, traveling when I can afford to, or gaming.(PlayStation is the way to go!)
